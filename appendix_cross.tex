This section presents image samples with the same text prompts from related work including DALL-E~\cite{ramesh2021zero} (Figure~\ref{figs:cross_reference_1}), GLIDE~\cite{nichol2021glide} (Figure~\ref{figs:cross_reference_2}), unCLIP~\cite{ramesh2022hierarchical} (Figure~\ref{figs:cross_reference_3}) and Imagen~\cite{imagen} (Figure~\ref{figs:cross_reference_4}) for cross reference and comparison. We exclude some text prompts or replace some sub-prompts with broader impact concerns that are discussed in Section~\ref{secs:broader}. We also add some new (sub-)prompts (noted in the caption) that are not from the related work to make four images per row for typography.
