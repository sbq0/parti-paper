This section describes the human evaluation procedure we conducted for evaluating model outputs. The website used for conducting these evaluations are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:human_evals_setup}. For each image, we request five independent annotators to select which of two (anonymized) models are preferred, for image realism and image-text match. Annotators were employed as contractors and were paid hourly wages that are competitive for their locale. They have standard rights as contractors. They are fluent non-native English speakers.
