\section{Qualitative comparison on MS-COCO}
\label{secs:appendix_qualitative_comparison}
Figure~\ref{figs:coco_model_comparison} shows a qualitative comparison of non-cherry-picked \bdraw sampled images along with outputs of other approaches~\cite{ramesh2021zero, nichol2021glide, gafni2022make, ramesh2022hierarchical} on MS-COCO prompts. \bdraw demonstrates strong generalization without fine-tuning on specific domains like MS-COCO, and it achieves a high degree of image realism that is typically very close to that of real images.
